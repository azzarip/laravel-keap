# Laravel Package for accessing the Keap REST API (v1 and v2)

Let's be honest, the php-infusionsoft SDK is shit.
Barely any support for modern version of PHP and all the laravel packages, such as the upwebdesign one, that has been the main inspiration for this package, rely on the old architecture and legacy version of the Infusionsoft API.

I jump in to ensure a Laravel 11+ support for this package that completely ignores the PHP SDK and builds it's own wrapper using Laravel helpers and architectures.
